# Tasks

Mark each task as done when you've completed it: 

1. [ ] Read `CLAUDE.md` and `llms.txt`. 

2. [ ] Implement the code from `PLAN.md`.

3. [ ] Analyze the recent git changes. 

4. [ ] Update the `README.md` to reflect the new structure of the code.

5. [ ] Update the `CHANGELOG.md` to reflect the new features and changes.

6. [ ] Edit `PLAN.md`: remove things that are done, keep things that are still TBD.
