CAUTION:
If answering a question requires checking specific files in the project, do not provide an answer immediately.
Instead, prompt the user with the following message:
"Please provide the actual filename including its full path."
When the user’s request involves adding or modifying multiple files, follow these steps:
1. First, list all relevant filenames with their full paths.
2. Wait for the user to confirm or specify which file to proceed with.
3. Then, show only the additions or modifications for the selected file.
4. Repeat this process for each file individually.
