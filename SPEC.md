# Advanced Video Temporal Alignment Techniques - Research Summary

## 1. Overview

Based on extensive research into state-of-the-art video temporal alignment techniques, here are the key findings and methods that could improve vidkompy's synchronization capabilities beyond basic DTW.

## 2. **Multi-Resolution and Hierarchical Approaches**

### 2.1. Hierarchical Temporal Alignment

- Process videos at multiple temporal resolutions simultaneously
- Align coarse features first, then refine at finer resolutions
- Benefits: Handles both global structure and local details effectively

### 2.2. Implementation Ideas:

```python
# Multi-scale temporal pyramid
- Level 0: Full resolution (every frame)
- Level 1: Every 2nd frame
- Level 2: Every 4th frame
- Level 3: Every 8th frame
```

## 3. **Optical Flow-Based Methods**

### 3.1. FlowVid Approach (CVPR 2024)

- Uses optical flow as a "soft condition" rather than hard constraint
- Handles imperfect flow estimation gracefully
- Combines spatial conditions (depth maps) with temporal flow information
- Key insight: Flow warping + spatial regularization = better alignment

### 3.2. Benefits:

- Robust to flow estimation errors
- Maintains temporal consistency
- 3-10x faster than previous methods

## 4. **Content-Aware Alignment**

### 4.1. Key Techniques:

1. **Feature-Level Alignment**

   - Use deep features (VGG, ResNet) for frame matching
   - Combine global and local features
   - Weight features based on content importance

2. **Semantic Correspondence**
   - Match frames based on semantic content, not just appearance
   - Use attention mechanisms to focus on important regions
   - Handle occlusions and appearance changes

## 5. **Advanced DTW Variants**

### 5.1. Diagonalized DTW (DDTW)

- Penalizes deviations from diagonal alignment
- Assumes videos of same action align roughly linearly
- Formula: Add penalty Î»(d-m) when distance d from diagonal exceeds margin m

### 5.2. Segmental DTW

- Parallelizable alternative to standard DTW
- Processes video segments independently
- Better for real-time applications

## 6. **Phase-Based Synchronization**

### 6.1. Approach:

1. Detect action phases/keyframes automatically
2. Align phases first, then interpolate between them
3. Use phase boundaries as anchor points

### 6.2. Benefits:

- More robust to speed variations
- Preserves action semantics
- Reduces drift accumulation

## 7. **Professional Video Editing Techniques**

### 7.1. Industry Standards:

- **Timecode-based sync**: Frame-accurate alignment using embedded timecodes
- **Audio waveform matching**: Visual alignment of audio peaks
- **Multicam workflows**: Sync multiple angles using common reference points

### 7.2. Adobe Premiere / DaVinci Resolve Methods:

- Automatic audio-based synchronization
- Manual marker-based alignment
- Subframe interpolation for perfect sync

## 8. **Addressing Drift and Catchup Issues**

### 8.1. Root Causes:

1. Accumulation of small alignment errors
2. Non-linear speed variations between videos
3. Frame drops or additions in one video

### 8.2. Solutions:

#### 8.2.1. A. Keyframe Anchoring

```python
# Pseudo-code
1. Detect reliable keyframes in both videos
2. Force alignment at keyframes
3. Interpolate alignment between keyframes
4. Recalibrate at each keyframe to prevent drift
```

#### 8.2.2. B. Bidirectional Alignment

- Align forward AND backward
- Average the two alignment paths
- Reduces systematic bias

#### 8.2.3. C. Temporal Regularization

- Add smoothness constraints to alignment
- Penalize sudden speed changes
- Use moving average of alignment ratios

#### 8.2.4. D. Adaptive Window DTW

- Use variable window sizes based on content
- Larger windows for slow motion
- Smaller windows for fast action

## 9. **Implementation Recommendations for vidkompy**

### 9.1. Priority 1: Keyframe-Based Alignment

1. Detect high-confidence keyframes (scene changes, motion peaks)
2. Align keyframes first using existing fingerprint matching
3. Use DTW only between keyframes
4. This prevents long-range drift

### 9.2. Priority 2: Optical Flow Integration

1. Estimate optical flow between consecutive frames
2. Use flow to validate/correct DTW alignment
3. Detect and handle flow estimation failures

### 9.3. Priority 3: Multi-Resolution Processing

1. Create temporal pyramid of videos
2. Align at coarse level first
3. Refine alignment at finer levels
4. Combine alignments across scales

### 9.4. Priority 4: Phase Detection

1. Implement automatic action phase detection
2. Use phases as alignment constraints
3. Allow different alignment strategies per phase

## 10. **Evaluation Metrics**

### 10.1. Beyond Current Metrics:

1. **Temporal Stability**: Measure speed variation consistency
2. **Semantic Accuracy**: Verify action correspondence
3. **Drift Measurement**: Track cumulative alignment error
4. **Perceptual Quality**: User studies on synchronization quality

## 11. **Quick Wins for vidkompy**

### 11.1. Immediate Improvements:

1. **Add drift correction**: Reset alignment every N frames
2. **Implement bidirectional DTW**: Average forward/backward paths
3. **Use adaptive DTW bands**: Vary band width based on confidence
4. **Add temporal smoothing**: Filter alignment path to reduce jitter

### 11.2. Code Snippet Example:

```python
def adaptive_dtw_with_drift_correction(features1, features2, reset_interval=100):
    """DTW with periodic drift correction"""
    full_path = []

    for start in range(0, len(features1), reset_interval):
        end = min(start + reset_interval, len(features1))

        # Run DTW on segment
        segment_path = dtw(features1[start:end],
                          features2[mapped_start:mapped_end])

        # Adjust path indices and append
        adjusted_path = adjust_path_indices(segment_path, start, mapped_start)
        full_path.extend(adjusted_path)

        # Update mapped_start for next segment
        mapped_start = adjusted_path[-1][1]

    return smooth_path(full_path)
```

## 12. Conclusion

The most promising approaches combine multiple techniques:

- Hierarchical/multi-resolution processing
- Optical flow as soft guidance
- Keyframe anchoring to prevent drift
- Content-aware feature matching
- Adaptive alignment strategies

For vidkompy, implementing keyframe-based alignment with drift correction would likely provide the most immediate improvement to the temporal synchronization quality.

# SPEC: Precise Temporal Alignment Engine

## 13. Overview

The 'precise' engine addresses the drift-and-catchup issues in the current 'fast' engine by implementing a multi-resolution temporal alignment strategy with dense frame matching and adaptive refinement.

## 14. Problem Statement

The current 'fast' engine suffers from temporal drift because:

1. Sparse keyframe sampling misses important temporal variations
2. Linear interpolation between keyframes doesn't capture actual frame relationships
3. The system falls back to direct mapping when keyframe matching fails
4. Fixed window constraints in DTW don't adapt to content complexity

## 15. Proposed Solution: Multi-Resolution Temporal Alignment

### 15.1. Core Algorithm

```
1. Coarse Alignment (Fast Pass)
   - Sample frames at multiple resolutions (1/16, 1/8, 1/4)
   - Use perceptual hashing for fast similarity computation
   - Apply DTW with large window to find initial alignment

2. Adaptive Refinement (Precision Pass)
   - Identify regions of high temporal change
   - Increase sampling density in complex regions
   - Use sliding window refinement around coarse alignment

3. Frame-by-Frame Verification
   - Verify alignment quality for each output frame
   - Apply local corrections where needed
   - Ensure monotonic progression
```

### 15.2. Key Components

#### 15.2.1. Multi-Resolution Sampling

```python
class MultiResolutionSampler:
    """Sample frames at multiple temporal resolutions"""
    resolutions = [16, 8, 4, 2, 1]  # Sample every Nth frame

    def sample_pyramid(frames, resolutions):
        """Create temporal pyramid of frame samples"""
        pyramid = {}
        for res in resolutions:
            pyramid[res] = frames[::res]
        return pyramid
```

#### 15.2.2. Adaptive Sampling Strategy

```python
class AdaptiveSampler:
    """Dynamically adjust sampling density based on content"""

    def compute_temporal_complexity(frames, window=5):
        """Measure temporal change between consecutive frames"""
        # Use frame differences to identify high-motion regions
        # Increase sampling where complexity is high

    def adaptive_sample(frames, complexity_map, budget):
        """Sample more densely in complex regions"""
        # Allocate sampling budget based on complexity
```

#### 15.2.3. Hierarchical DTW Alignment

```python
class HierarchicalDTW:
    """Multi-resolution DTW with progressive refinement"""

    def align_coarse_to_fine(fg_pyramid, bg_pyramid):
        """Align from coarse to fine resolutions"""
        # Start with lowest resolution
        # Use result to constrain higher resolutions
        # Progressively refine alignment
```

#### 15.2.4. Sliding Window Refinement

```python
class SlidingWindowRefiner:
    """Local refinement around initial alignment"""

    def refine_alignment(fg_frames, bg_frames, initial_mapping, window=30):
        """Refine alignment in local windows"""
        # For each window of frames
        # Re-align within constrained search space
        # Smooth transitions between windows
```

#### 15.2.5. Confidence-Based Interpolation

```python
class ConfidenceInterpolator:
    """Interpolate between keyframes based on similarity confidence"""

    def interpolate_with_confidence(keyframe_pairs, confidences):
        """Use frame similarities to guide interpolation"""
        # Higher confidence = trust linear interpolation
        # Lower confidence = search for better matches nearby
```

### 15.3. Implementation Details

2. Sample frames at current resolution
3. Apply DTW with constrained search window
4. Refine temporal mapping

#### 15.3.3. Phase 3: Dense Verification
