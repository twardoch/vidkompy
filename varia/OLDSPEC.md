# TODO for vidoverlay.py

<problem>
`vidoverlay.py` is a Python CLI (Fire) tool that lets me overlay two videos: --bg (background) and --fg (foreground), and saves the result to --output (name is built automatically if not provided).

The tool needs to be robust and smart.

1. The bg video can be larger than the fg video. In that case, the tool needs to automatically find the best offset to overlay the fg video on the bg video.

2. The bg and fg videos can have different FPSes. In that case, the tool needs to use the higher FPS for the output video.

3. The bg and fg videos may have different durations (the difference would be typically rather slight). In that case, the tool needs to use the longer duration, and needs to find the optimal time offset to overlay the fg video on the bg video.

4. The bg and fg videos may have sound (it would be identical, but may be offset). If both have sound, the sound may be used to find the right time offset for the overlay, and the background sound would be used for the output video. If only one has sound, that sound is used for the output video.

5. The content of the two videos would typically be very similar but not identical, because one video is typically a recompressed, edited variant of the other.

6. All these conditions may be combined. That means, the tool needs to be able to find both the spatial and the temporal offsets. Spatially, the fg video is never larger than the bg video. Temporally, either video can be longer.

<guidelines>
# When you write code

- Iterate gradually, avoiding major changes
- Minimize confirmations and checks
- Preserve existing code/structure unless necessary
- Use constants over magic numbers
- Check for existing solutions in the codebase before starting
- Check often the coherence of the code you’re writing with the rest of the code.
- Focus on minimal viable increments and ship early
- Write explanatory docstrings/comments that explain what and WHY this does, explain where and how the code is used/referred to elsewhere in the code
- Analyze code line-by-line
- Handle failures gracefully with retries, fallbacks, user guidance
- Address edge cases, validate assumptions, catch errors early
- Let the computer do the work, minimize user decisions
- Reduce cognitive load, beautify code
- Modularize repeated logic into concise, single-purpose functions
- Favor flat over nested structures
- Consistently keep, document, update and consult the holistic overview mental image of the codebase:
  - README.md (purpose and functionality)
  - CHANGELOG.md (past changes)
  - TODO.md (future goals)
  - PROGRESS.md (detailed flat task list)

## Keep track of paths

In each source file, maintain the up-to-date `this_file` record that shows the path of the current file relative to project root. Place the `this_file` record near the top of the file, as a comment after the shebangs, or in the YAML Markdown frontmatter.

## When you write Python

- Use `uv pip`, never `pip`
- Use `python -m` when running code
- PEP 8: Use consistent formatting and naming
- Write clear, descriptive names for functions and variables
- PEP 20: Keep code simple and explicit. Prioritize readability over cleverness
- Use type hints in their simplest form (list, dict, | for unions)
- PEP 257: Write clear, imperative docstrings
- Use f-strings. Use structural pattern matching where appropriate
- ALWAYS add "verbose" mode logugu-based logging, & debug-log
- For CLI Python scripts, use fire & rich, and start the script with

```
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run -s
# /// script
# dependencies = ["PKG1", "PKG2"]
# ///
# this_file: PATH_TO_CURRENT_FILE
```

Ask before extending/refactoring existing code in a way that may add complexity or break things.

When you’re finished, print "Wait, but" to go back, think & reflect, revise & improvement what you’ve done (but don’t invent functionality freely). Repeat this. But stick to the goal of "minimal viable next version". Lead two experts: "Ideot" for creative, unorthodox ideas, and "Critin" to critique flawed thinking and moderate for balanced discussions. The three of you shall illuminate knowledge with concise, beautiful responses, process methodically for clear answers, collaborate step-by-step, sharing thoughts and adapting. If errors are found, step back and focus on accuracy and progress.

## After Python changes run:

```
fd -e py -x autoflake {}; fd -e py -x pyupgrade --py312-plus {}; fd -e py -x ruff check --output-format=github --fix --unsafe-fixes {}; fd -e py -x ruff format --respect-gitignore --target-version py312 {}; python -m pytest;
```

Be creative, diligent, critical, relentless & funny!

## Video Overlay Tool: Comprehensive Research and Development Plan

This report presents a thorough analysis and strategic plan for developing `vidoverlay.py`, an intelligent Python CLI tool for overlaying two videos with automatic spatial and temporal alignment capabilities. The tool addresses complex challenges in video synchronization, audio alignment, and adaptive overlay positioning through a combination of established computer vision techniques and modern video processing frameworks.

## Video Processing Framework Analysis

### FFmpeg-Python Integration

The foundation of our video overlay tool relies heavily on FFmpeg's robust video processing capabilities accessed through Python bindings[7]. FFmpeg-python provides a sophisticated interface for complex video operations, including overlay filters that support precise positioning and timing controls[17][18][19]. The overlay filter in FFmpeg accepts two input streams and allows positioning through coordinate parameters, making it ideal for our spatial alignment requirements[17].

For basic overlay operations, FFmpeg uses the syntax `ffmpeg.filter([video1, video2], 'overlay', x, y)` where x and y coordinates determine the overlay position[17]. Advanced positioning can utilize variables like `(main_w-overlay_w)/2` for centering or `(main_w-overlay_w)` for right alignment[19]. The framework also supports time-based overlay controls through the `enable` parameter, allowing temporal synchronization with expressions like `enable='between(t,0,20)'`[20].

### Alternative Processing Frameworks

MoviePy presents another viable approach for video compositing, offering a more Pythonic interface for video manipulation[6]. The CompositeVideoClip class provides layered video composition with automatic duration and FPS handling[6]. However, FFmpeg-python offers superior performance and more granular control over encoding parameters, making it the preferred choice for our robust overlay tool.

OpenCV integration becomes essential for spatial alignment algorithms, particularly for template matching and feature detection when determining optimal overlay positions[2][5]. The combination of OpenCV for computer vision tasks and FFmpeg for video processing creates a powerful synergy for intelligent video overlay operations.

## Spatial Alignment Methodologies

### Template Matching Approaches

Template matching using OpenCV provides a foundation for automatic spatial alignment when the foreground video is smaller than the background[5]. The `cv2.matchTemplate()` function can identify optimal overlay positions by comparing foreground frames against background frames[5]. This approach works effectively when there are distinguishable features or patterns that can guide the alignment process.

The vs_align project demonstrates advanced spatial alignment techniques using deep learning models for warping frames towards reference frames[4]. These methods employ 3D space-time convolutions and precision levels ranging from 1-4, offering subpixel accuracy for alignment tasks[4]. The implementation supports CUDA acceleration and can handle complex distortions, rotations, and scaling differences between video sources.

### Feature-Based Alignment

More sophisticated spatial alignment can be achieved through feature detection and matching algorithms. OpenCV provides SIFT, SURF, and ORB feature detectors that can identify key points in both videos and establish correspondence for optimal overlay positioning. This approach proves particularly valuable when dealing with videos that may have slight perspective differences or when the optimal overlay position isn't immediately obvious through simple template matching.

## Temporal Synchronization Strategies

### Audio Cross-Correlation

Audio-based synchronization represents the most reliable method for temporal alignment when both videos contain audio tracks[9][11][12]. Cross-correlation analysis of audio signals can identify time offsets with high precision, particularly effective for recordings of the same event from different positions[9]. Google's research demonstrates that spectral flatness outperforms zero-crossing rate and signal energy as audio features for synchronization tasks[12].

The skelly-synchronize package provides a practical implementation of audio-based video synchronization using cross-correlation techniques[11]. This approach works particularly well when videos contain distinct audio events like claps or other sharp sounds that create clear correlation peaks[11]. The method involves extracting audio features, computing cross-correlation, and identifying the time delay corresponding to maximum correlation.

### Multi-Signal Synchronization

For more complex scenarios involving multiple timing relationships, graph-based approaches using Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) or Belief Propagation techniques offer robust solutions[12]. These methods construct graphs from pairwise signal comparisons and can handle outliers and noise in the synchronization process. The MST approach provides computational efficiency with O(N log N) complexity while maintaining excellent synchronization accuracy.

### Brightness-Based Synchronization

When audio synchronization isn't available, brightness-based methods can detect synchronization points through sudden illumination changes visible across multiple camera angles[11]. This technique requires significant brightness changes like flash photography or lighting transitions but provides an alternative when audio correlation isn't feasible.

## Frame Rate and Duration Handling

### FPS Harmonization

Video frame interpolation techniques become crucial when handling videos with different frame rates[10][16]. FLAVR (Flow-Agnostic Video Representations) uses 3D space-time convolutions for efficient frame interpolation, enabling smooth conversion between different frame rates[10]. The tool should automatically detect the higher frame rate and interpolate the lower frame rate video to match, ensuring temporal consistency in the final overlay.

Modern transformer-based approaches for video frame interpolation offer superior results for FPS conversion tasks[16]. These methods can capture long-range pixel dependencies and provide better temporal consistency compared to traditional optical flow methods. However, for our overlay tool, simpler interpolation methods may suffice given the primary focus on overlay positioning rather than artistic video enhancement.

### Duration Optimization

When videos have different durations, the tool must intelligently determine the optimal temporal alignment window. This involves analyzing the content overlap, identifying the most significant portions of each video, and maximizing the effective overlay duration while maintaining synchronization quality. The approach should consider both the absolute duration difference and the relative importance of different temporal segments.

## Audio Processing Strategy

### Audio Track Selection

The tool requires sophisticated audio handling logic to determine which audio track to use in the final output[9]. When both videos contain audio, cross-correlation analysis serves dual purposes: temporal synchronization and audio quality assessment. The audio track with better signal quality or clearer content should be selected for the output, with the temporal offset applied to maintain synchronization.

Audio preprocessing may involve noise reduction, normalization, and feature extraction to improve correlation accuracy[12]. Techniques like envelope detection (using `abs(hilbert(signal))`) can enhance correlation results by focusing on amplitude variations rather than raw audio data[9]. This preprocessing step proves particularly valuable when dealing with noisy recordings or different recording qualities between videos.

### Fallback Audio Strategies

When only one video contains audio, the tool should preserve that audio track while still attempting temporal alignment through visual features. This scenario requires alternative synchronization methods such as brightness correlation, motion analysis, or user-defined alignment points. The tool should gracefully handle these situations while providing feedback about the synchronization confidence level.

## Implementation Architecture

### Modular Design Principles

The tool architecture should follow a modular design with separate components for spatial alignment, temporal synchronization, audio processing, and video composition. Each module should operate independently with well-defined interfaces, allowing for future enhancements and algorithm substitutions. The main workflow coordinates these modules while providing user feedback and progress indication.

Key modules include:
- **VideoAnalyzer**: Extracts metadata, resolution, FPS, duration, and audio presence
- **SpatialAligner**: Implements template matching and feature-based alignment
- **TemporalSynchronizer**: Handles audio correlation and alternative timing methods
- **AudioProcessor**: Manages audio track selection and preprocessing
- **VideoComposer**: Orchestrates final overlay generation using FFmpeg

### Error Handling and Robustness

The tool must implement comprehensive error handling for various failure scenarios: unsupported video formats, corrupted files, insufficient memory, or alignment algorithm failures. Each processing stage should include validation checkpoints with meaningful error messages and suggested remediation steps. The implementation should provide fallback options when automatic alignment fails, allowing users to specify manual offsets.

### Performance Optimization

Processing large video files requires careful memory management and efficient algorithms. The tool should implement streaming processing where possible, avoiding loading entire videos into memory simultaneously. GPU acceleration through CUDA should be leveraged for computationally intensive operations like template matching and feature detection. Progress indicators and time estimates help users understand processing duration for large files.

## Conclusion

The development of `vidoverlay.py` requires integrating multiple computer vision and signal processing techniques into a cohesive, user-friendly tool. The combination of FFmpeg for video processing, OpenCV for spatial alignment, and audio cross-correlation for temporal synchronization provides a robust foundation for intelligent video overlay operations. Success depends on careful implementation of each component with appropriate fallback mechanisms and comprehensive error handling to ensure reliability across diverse video inputs and use cases.

The tool's intelligence lies not just in individual algorithms but in the orchestration of these techniques to handle the complex combinations of spatial and temporal misalignments that users will encounter in real-world scenarios. By following modular design principles and implementing progressive enhancement capabilities, the tool can evolve to meet increasingly sophisticated overlay requirements while maintaining simplicity for basic use cases.

# Plan by Claude

This comprehensive implementation plan synthesizes research across video processing libraries, computer vision algorithms, audio synchronization techniques, and performance optimization strategies to create a robust Python CLI tool for intelligent video overlay with automatic spatial and temporal alignment.

## Core Technology Stack Recommendations

Based on extensive benchmarking and analysis, the recommended technology stack combines **OpenCV for core processing, VidGear for performance optimization, and specialized libraries for advanced features**. This hybrid approach provides optimal balance between performance, features, and development efficiency.

### Primary Libraries Selection

**Video Processing Foundation:**
- **VidGear + OpenCV**: Core video I/O and processing (30% faster than pure OpenCV)
- **PyAV**: Hardware-accelerated encoding for final output
- **RIFE v4.25+**: AI-based frame interpolation for FPS conversion

**Audio Processing:**
- **librosa**: Audio extraction and analysis
- **scipy.signal**: GCC-PHAT cross-correlation implementation
- **soundfile**: High-quality audio I/O

**Performance Optimization:**
- **CuPy/CUDA**: GPU acceleration for supported operations
- **multiprocessing**: CPU-parallel processing for chunks
- **memory-mapped files**: Efficient handling of large videos

## Spatial Alignment Algorithm Strategy

The research indicates a **multi-algorithm approach** provides the best robustness across different scenarios:

### Primary Algorithm: Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow
- **Speed**: 5-20ms per frame (excellent for real-time)
- **Accuracy**: Sub-pixel precision for small motions
- **Implementation**: Mature OpenCV implementation available
- **Use case**: Continuous tracking during video playback

### Secondary Algorithm: ORB + RANSAC
- **Speed**: 30-100ms per frame
- **Robustness**: Handles rotation and larger displacements
- **Accuracy**: Good for scene changes and initialization
- **Fallback**: Activates when optical flow confidence drops

### Implementation Architecture
```python
class SpatialAligner:
    def __init__(self, method='hybrid'):
        self.optical_flow_tracker = LucasKanadeTracker()
        self.feature_matcher = ORBMatcher()
        self.confidence_threshold = 0.8
    
    def align_frames(self, background, foreground):
        # Try optical flow first (fast path)
        result, confidence = self.optical_flow_tracker.track(background, foreground)
        
        if confidence < self.confidence_threshold:
            # Fallback to feature matching
            result = self.feature_matcher.match(background, foreground)
        
        return result
```

## Temporal Alignment via Audio Synchronization

Research strongly supports **GCC-PHAT (Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform)** for robust audio-based temporal alignment:

### Audio Sync Pipeline
1. **Extraction**: Use librosa at 16kHz for speech, 44.1kHz for music
2. **Preprocessing**: Apply high-pass filtering and VAD (Voice Activity Detection)
3. **Correlation**: GCC-PHAT provides noise-robust synchronization
4. **Refinement**: Parabolic interpolation for sub-sample precision

### Key Implementation
```python
def gcc_phat_sync(audio1, audio2, sample_rate=16000):
    # FFT-based correlation
    n = len(audio1) + len(audio2) - 1
    X = np.fft.fft(audio1, n)
    Y = np.fft.fft(audio2, n)
    R = X * np.conj(Y)
    R = R / np.abs(R)  # Phase normalization
    correlation = np.fft.ifft(R)
    
    # Find peak with sub-sample precision
    peak_idx = np.argmax(np.abs(correlation))
    offset_seconds = peak_idx / sample_rate
    return offset_seconds
```

## FPS Handling Strategy

### Recommended Approach: RIFE AI Interpolation
- **Quality**: PSNR 35+ dB, SSIM 0.97+
- **Speed**: 30+ FPS for 720p 2X interpolation
- **Flexibility**: Handles arbitrary frame rate conversions
- **Fallback**: OpenCV optical flow interpolation for older hardware

### Implementation Pattern
```python
class FrameRateConverter:
    def __init__(self, method='rife', device='auto'):
        if method == 'rife' and self._check_gpu():
            self.interpolator = RIFEInterpolator()

        else:
            return self._interpolate(frames, source_fps, target_fps)

        ]
    
    def process(self, background_path, foreground_path, output_path):

        context.background_path = background_path
        context.foreground_path = foreground_path
        context.output_path = output_path
        
        for stage in self.stages:
            context = stage.execute(context)
            if context.error:
                return self._handle_error(context)
        
        return context.result
```

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Memory Management
```python
class ChunkedVideoProcessor:
    def __init__(self, chunk_duration=2.0):  # 2-second chunks
        self.chunk_duration = chunk_duration
        self.frame_buffer = collections.deque(maxlen=100)
    
    def process_video(self, video_path):
        with VideoReader(video_path) as reader:
            chunk = []
            for frame in reader:
                chunk.append(frame)
                if len(chunk) >= self.chunk_size:
                    yield self._process_chunk(chunk)
                    chunk = []
```

### GPU Acceleration Pattern
```python
class GPUAccelerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.device = self._select_best_device()
    
    def process_batch(self, frames):
        if self.device == 'cuda':
            return self._cuda_process(frames)
        elif self.device == 'opencl':
            return self._opencl_process(frames)
        else:
            return self._cpu_fallback(frames)
```

### Multi-threading Strategy
- **I/O Operations**: ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent file access
- **CPU Processing**: ProcessPoolExecutor for parallel chunk processing
- **GPU Operations**: Single GPU thread with batching for efficiency

            self._check_corruption,
            self._check_audio_presence,
            self._check_resolution_compatibility
        ]
        
        for check in checks:
            result = check(video_path)
            if not result.success:
                return result
        
        return ValidationResult(success=True)
```

### Robust Error Recovery

- **Memory Exhaustion**: Switch to disk-based processing
- **GPU Failures**: Transparent CPU fallback
- **Alignment Failures**: Progressive quality degradation

# Plan by ChatGPT

## Overview and Objectives

**`vidoverlay.py`** will overlay a foreground video (`--fg`) on top of a background video (`--bg`) to produce a combined output (`--output`). The design focuses on **robust, intelligent alignment** of the videos (spatially and temporally) over raw processing speed. Only one pair of videos is processed per run. Key goals include:

* **Format Support:** Handle common formats like `.mp4` and `.mov` for both input videos.
* **Spatial Alignment:** Automatically determine where to place the smaller video on the larger (top-left, centered, or a content-matched position) without user input.
* **Temporal Alignment:** Automatically sync the timeline of the foreground onto the background (find the best start time offset), primarily by analyzing audio tracks.
* **Frame Rate & Duration:** Use the higher frame rate of the two videos for output, and ensure the output covers the longer duration of the two.
* **Audio Handling:** Choose the appropriate audio track for output – typically the background’s audio if both have sound (aligning peaks to sync), or whichever video has audio if only one does – avoiding mixing unless necessary.
* **Output Composition:** Produce a single video file with the foreground video overlaid on the background at the computed spatial offset and starting at the computed temporal offset.

This plan details the tools/libraries to use, strategies for alignment, fallbacks for reliability, an outline of implementation steps, and best practices (modularity, logging, clarity). The emphasis is on accuracy and maintainability, even if computations are more intensive.

## Tools and Libraries Evaluation

To meet the above requirements with minimal yet powerful dependencies, we’ll leverage the strengths of proven libraries and tools:

* **FFmpeg (via subprocess or wrapper):** FFmpeg is a robust choice for decoding, processing, and encoding video/audio. We will use FFmpeg to retrieve video metadata (via `ffprobe`), extract audio streams, and perform the final video overlay composition. FFmpeg’s `overlay` filter will handle merging the video streams, supporting offsets in time and position. It natively supports MP4/MOV and can combine videos of different lengths (by default the output can use the longest stream’s duration). Using FFmpeg ensures efficient video frame handling and encoding.

* **OpenCV (cv2) for Image Analysis:** OpenCV provides convenient methods for image-based alignment. We will use OpenCV **only for analysis**, not for final rendering. Specifically:

  * *Template Matching:* If the foreground appears as a subset of the background image (e.g. smaller region in a larger frame), we can use `cv2.matchTemplate` to slide the foreground frame over a background frame to find the best match. This gives the top-left (x, y) where the similarity is highest, indicating where to place the FG on BG for best visual alignment.
  * *Feature Matching:* If template matching is insufficient (e.g. angle/scale differences or partial overlap), OpenCV’s feature detection (ORB/SIFT) and homography estimation can align images based on keypoints. This is more robust to perspective or lighting changes. We will attempt feature matching if simple pixel correlation fails or if there’s significant rotation/scale variance.
  * OpenCV is a heavy dependency, but its use is justified by the need for accurate spatial alignment. We will use it in a modular way (i.e., optional if advanced alignment is needed). If dependency footprint is a concern, this part can be optional or replaced with a simpler strategy.

* **Audio Processing Library:** For temporal alignment, analyzing audio waveforms is crucial. Options:

  * *Librosa:* A high-level library that can load audio in various formats and provide utilities for cross-correlation and peak detection. Librosa simplifies reading audio and resampling, but it brings many dependencies (NumPy, SciPy, etc.).
  * *SciPy + Soundfile:* An alternative is to use `soundfile` (or Python’s `wave` module after using FFmpeg to convert audio to WAV) to read raw audio samples, then use `numpy` or `scipy.signal` for cross-correlation. SciPy’s `signal.correlate` with FFT method is efficient and yields the similarity as a function of time offset. This approach avoids the heavier music-analysis features of librosa.
  * We prefer a minimal approach: use FFmpeg to extract audio to a WAV (ensuring a consistent sample rate and mono channel), then use `numpy/scipy` to compute cross-correlation. This keeps dependencies light while leveraging optimized C routines through SciPy/NumPy.
  * If SciPy is considered too heavy, a pure NumPy FFT-based correlation can be implemented manually (since Python 3.12 we can rely on vectorized operations and possibly the built-in `math` improvements, but SciPy’s implementation is likely fine).
  * **Librosa vs SciPy Decision:** If high accuracy onset detection or more complex analysis (like Dynamic Time Warping for audio) were needed, librosa could be justified. However, cross-correlation suffices for finding a static offset in most cases, so we lean toward SciPy/NumPy for minimalism.

* **Logging with Loguru:** For maintainability and debuggability, we’ll integrate the **Loguru** library for logging. Loguru drastically simplifies Python logging setup by providing a pre-configured `logger` with sensible defaults and rich features, eliminating the boilerplate of the standard `logging` module. Using Loguru, we can easily add debug/info logs for steps like “Loaded video metadata”, “Computed spatial offset (x,y)”, “Audio offset = 2.35s”, etc. This makes it easy to trace the program’s behavior and diagnose issues without clutter. We’ll configure Loguru to log to console (and optionally to a file) with clear formatting (timestamps, severity levels, possibly function names) to facilitate debugging.

* **Other Considerations:** We will use Python’s built-in libraries where possible:

  * `argparse` for CLI argument parsing (to handle `--bg`, `--fg`, `--output` and any optional flags).
  * `subprocess` to call FFmpeg/ffprobe commands (ensuring to capture output or errors).
  * Possibly `numpy` for any numeric processing (which is typically installed with SciPy/OpenCV anyway).
  * We will avoid larger video editing libraries like MoviePy or PyAV to keep dependencies minimal; FFmpeg and OpenCV together cover our needs in a more controlled way (MoviePy internally uses ffmpeg too, but introduces another abstraction layer and overhead).

## Spatial Alignment Strategy (Video Overlay Positioning)

Accurate spatial alignment ensures the foreground video is placed in the correct location on the background. The tool will automatically decide the `(x, y)` offset for the FG overlay within the BG frame. The strategy is:

1. **Determine Relative Sizes:** Fetch the resolution (width × height) of both videos. If the background’s frame is larger than the foreground’s, it implies we have room to position the FG within BG. If the foreground is larger (or equal) in resolution, then FG would cover BG entirely if overlaid at full size – in such cases we may need to scale down FG or simply overlay it without seeing BG behind (not typical, but we’ll handle it).

2. **Content-Based Alignment (If Possible):** When BG is larger, attempt to find where FG *best fits visually* on BG:

   * **Template Matching:** Assume at some point, the FG frame content might appear in the BG (e.g., FG is a zoomed-in portion of the scene shown in BG). We can take a representative frame from the FG (for example, the first frame or a frame at the video’s midpoint) and search for it inside a corresponding frame of BG. Using OpenCV’s `matchTemplate`, we slide the FG image over the BG image and compute a similarity score at each position. The highest scoring position indicates where FG most closely matches part of BG. We will use a normalized correlation method (e.g., `cv.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED`) for robustness to lighting differences. If the max score is above a threshold (meaning a confident match), we use that position as the overlay location. This automates choosing between, say, top-left vs center – it will pick the position with actual content alignment.
   * **Feature Matching:** If direct template matching fails (low max score or significant scale/rotation differences), use feature-based alignment. We can detect keypoints in both FG and BG frames (using ORB or SIFT algorithms) and find matching features. With enough matches, estimate a homography (transformation) that maps FG onto BG. From the homography or matched keypoints, derive the translation (x, y offset). Since we only allow translation (no rotation or scaling of FG for overlay, unless we decide to scale), we might simplify by taking the average displacement of matched features. Feature matching is more robust to perspective changes; as a community expert noted, if there’s noise or angle variation, feature matching with homography is the way to go. We’ll use ORB (which is free and fast) to keep dependencies minimal (SIFT would require OpenCV’s contrib package, ORB is built-in and should suffice for finding correspondences).
   * **Similarity Metrics:** If neither template nor feature matching is applicable (e.g., the videos are unrelated scenes), the algorithm cannot find a “meaningful” position. In such a case we need a safe default (next step).

3. **Fallback Placement:** If no strong content correlation is found or if BG and FG share no visual relationship:

   * We choose a sensible default alignment. This could be **centered** overlay (placing FG at the center of BG) which is generally aesthetically balanced, or top-left if a deterministic position is preferred. The prompt suggests considering “top-left” or “center” when auto alignment is not feasible, so we’ll likely default to **center** (unless specified otherwise by the user or further context).
   * We will log a warning if we resort to default placement (e.g., “No reliable spatial match found; defaulting to center placement.”), so the user is aware.

4. **Scaling Consideration:** If FG video dimensions exceed BG’s (FG larger than BG):

   * To overlay properly, we may **scale down** the FG to fit within BG. The tool can automatically resize FG to at most the BG’s width/height (preserving aspect ratio). FFmpeg’s scaling filter or OpenCV can be used for this scaling. For simplicity, we can have FFmpeg handle scaling in the filter graph (e.g., using `scale=w:h` before overlay).
   * We will note this scenario and perhaps treat it as a special case of spatial alignment: basically, center the scaled FG on BG (or fill BG completely with FG if that was intended). If FG is only slightly larger, cropping could be an option, but scaling is safer to avoid losing content.
   * This is a fallback to maintain output clarity: we don’t want FG hanging off the edges of BG frame.

5. **Transparency Handling:** (Not explicitly requested, but worth noting) If the FG has an alpha channel (e.g., a .mov with transparency), FFmpeg’s overlay can respect that and composite accordingly. We should ensure to use the overlay filter in a way that retains alpha if present, or manually add `format=auto, alpha` settings. If no transparency, FG will fully obscure BG in the overlay region, which is expected.

In summary, the spatial alignment step will attempt an intelligent placement using computer vision techniques, and default to a defined position if needed. All computations will use only a frame or a few frames (to keep it timely). We prioritize accuracy: slight extra computation (e.g., searching the entire frame or computing features) is acceptable given the one-time alignment cost per video pair.

*Example:* Suppose `bg.mp4` is 1920×1080 and `fg.mov` is 640×360. If `fg` is actually a cropped portion of `bg` (say a zoomed view of one corner), template matching might find that corner location on `bg` with high confidence. We then overlay `fg` at that (x,y) offset. If they’re unrelated content, no strong match, so we’d simply place `fg` centered (i.e., at (640px, 360px) offset on a 1920×1080 background, which centers it).

## Temporal Alignment Strategy (Synchronizing Timelines)

To determine the optimal time offset for overlaying the foreground video on the background, we leverage audio waveform analysis. The assumption is that if both videos capture the same event or scene, their audio tracks (if present) will have similar patterns (e.g. the same sounds, speech, or distinct noises like a clap) that can be aligned. Our approach:

1. **Audio Extraction:** If both videos have audio tracks, extract them to raw data for analysis. Using FFmpeg, we can demux the audio to WAV files (mono, with a common sample rate, e.g., 16 kHz for efficiency). For example:

   ```
   ffmpeg -i background.mp4 -ac 1 -ar 16000 bg_audio.wav
   ffmpeg -i foreground.mov -ac 1 -ar 16000 fg_audio.wav
   ```

   This ensures both audio arrays are comparable (same sampling rate and single channel). If one video has stereo and the other mono, we downmix to mono to simplify correlation.

2. **Cross-Correlation of Audio Signals:** With NumPy/SciPy, compute the cross-correlation between the two audio signals. We’ll treat one audio as the “reference” (likely the background audio) and slide the other over it to measure similarity at each possible offset. Cross-correlation `R(τ)` will be high when the signals align. We can use `scipy.signal.correlate` in `'full'` mode (or via FFT convolution) to get the similarity for each lag. This yields an array of correlation values, where the index of the maximum value indicates the best alignment point. If `idx_max` is the lag (in samples) where correlation is highest, we convert that to time offset: `offset_seconds = idx_max / sample_rate` (taking into account the indexing such that a positive lag means FG audio starts later in BG timeline, etc.). We will be careful with interpretation:

   * If the peak corresponds to FG audio delayed relative to BG, that positive time is exactly how many seconds into BG the FG should start.
   * If the peak suggests FG audio leads BG (negative lag), it means FG started earlier. In that case, the BG should actually start later in FG’s timeline. Since BG is our primary timeline (starting at t=0 in output), a negative lag would imply FG should start at t=0 and BG is effectively offset – but we won’t shift BG, so instead we’d trim the beginning of FG (or simply not overlay the initial part) such that FG enters immediately at output t=0. In practice, we can cap the offset at 0 for output (or consider padding BG with silence if we wanted FG to keep its entire length).
   * We will log the found offset and how it’s applied.

   Using cross-correlation is a robust way to align two recordings: it measures similarity at all possible time shifts and finds the peak where the waveforms best match (e.g., aligning distinctive audio peaks). This method is widely used for syncing multi-camera recordings by sound.

3. **Alternative Audio Alignment Approaches:** In addition to raw cross-correlation, we consider:

   * **Onset/Pulse Alignment:** If the audio has a single distinct event (like a clap or beep used for sync), one could simply detect that peak in both and align them. However, a general solution uses full cross-correlation as above, which inherently aligns all peaks collectively.
   * **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW):** Not required here because we assume no intentional speed differences – videos run at normal speed, just starting at different times. DTW could align non-linear timing (like matching a song to a cover with tempo drift), but here we just need a fixed offset.
   * **Audio Fingerprinting:** Libraries like **audalign** or **dejavu** could find offsets by recognizing matching audio patterns even with noise. This could be overkill for our use, but it’s worth noting as a robust method for very long recordings or when cross-correlation is too slow (fingerprinting condenses audio to identifiable hashes). Since we want minimal dependencies, we skip dedicated fingerprint libraries, but our design can incorporate them later if needed (for example, if we needed to align long recordings quickly by identifying matching segments).

4. **When One or Both Videos Have No Audio:**

   * If only one video has an audio track (the other is silent), we cannot directly compute an audio-based offset. In this case, we will default to aligning start times (offset = 0), **or** use any other cues if available (for instance, if the user *knew* the timing or if we attempted video-content alignment – which is complex and not guaranteed). We’ll clearly log that we skipped audio alignment due to lack of a second audio track.
   * If neither video has audio, there’s no basis for automatic temporal alignment. We would then overlay from t=0 by default. (A potential advanced approach: use video frame analysis to find sync – e.g., match timestamps on a clapperboard flash – but that’s beyond scope unless such a feature is explicitly needed.)

5. **Applying the Temporal Offset:** Once we have the desired start time for FG relative to BG, we integrate this into the output:

   * Using FFmpeg, we have a couple of options:

     * Apply an input **timestamp offset** for the FG video stream (and its audio). FFmpeg’s `-itsoffset <secs>` can delay an input. For example, if FG should start 3.5s into BG, we can invoke `ffmpeg -i background.mp4 -itsoffset 3.5 -i foreground.mp4 ... overlay=...`. This effectively pads 3.5 seconds of silence/blank for the FG input before playback, aligning it on the timeline.
     * Or use the overlay filter’s **`enable`** option with an expression: e.g. `overlay=x:y:enable='gte(t,<offset>)'`. This will make the FG appear only after `t = offset`. We could also use `enable='between(t, start, end)'` if we want to explicitly stop FG at a certain time, but since we will output the full duration (longest of the two), we might not need an explicit end (the FG simply won’t overlay beyond its length).
     * We prefer `-itsoffset` for simplicity, as it automatically handles both video and FG’s audio sync (if FG audio is used or if we need to drop it, we still keep streams aligned). We must ensure that when using `-itsoffset`, we also use `-map` correctly so that we don’t accidentally include FG’s padded silence audio if we’re not using FG audio.
   * If the computed offset is fractional (likely it will be, e.g. 1.27 seconds), FFmpeg can handle sub-second offsets. We will format it to a fraction or decimal (e.g., `itsoffset 1.27`). The cross-correlation result will be rounded or interpolated to the nearest sample; our sampling rate (say 16000 Hz) gives time resolution of 0.0000625s, which is more than enough precision for syncing within a few milliseconds.

6. **Verification:** As a debug feature, we might output some diagnostic info: e.g., log the correlation peak value to indicate confidence, or even allow an optional flag to plot the waveform alignment (this could be an extended feature, not core). But at least logging the offset in seconds and maybe the correlation peak ratio (peak vs next best) will help verify the alignment’s reliability.

By aligning audio peaks, we ensure that the videos play in sync. For example, if FG video was a secondary camera that started recording 5 seconds after the main BG camera, our tool will detect that the audio waveforms best align when FG is offset 5s later on BG. Thus, in the output, FG will begin at 5s mark on the BG video, resulting in synchronized footage (and since we’ll be using BG’s audio in that scenario, the audio will naturally be continuous and synced with the combined video).

## Frame Rate and Duration Management

**Frame Rate (FPS):** The output video should use the higher frame rate of the two inputs to preserve motion detail:

* We will retrieve the FPS of both input videos (using `ffprobe` or OpenCV’s `VideoCapture.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)`). Suppose BG is 24 fps and FG is 30 fps; we’ll target 30 fps for the output.
* FFmpeg can automatically handle differing frame rates when overlaying by default, but to be explicit, we can set the output framerate. For example, add `-r 30` for the output or use a filter like `fps=fps=30`. We must also ensure frame timestamps are handled correctly:

  * We may use the filter `setpts=PTS-STARTPTS` on both videos’ streams inside the filter\_complex, which resets timestamps to 0 and lets FFmpeg synchronize them. When using `-itsoffset` for FG, FG’s PTS are already shifted appropriately relative to BG.
  * The video with the lower FPS will effectively have frames held longer or duplicated to match the timeline of the higher FPS stream. This is usually fine (e.g., duplicating frames to go from 24 to 30 fps). If a more sophisticated frame interpolation were needed, we could integrate a motion interpolation filter, but that’s beyond MVP scope – duplicating frames maintains sync and is simpler.
* By choosing the higher FPS, we avoid temporal downsampling of the smoother video. The trade-off is the smaller video (if originally lower FPS) might look slightly choppier compared to true 30fps, but at least no additional choppiness is introduced to the originally higher-FPS video.

**Video Duration (Output Length):** We will use the **longer duration** of the two videos for the output, as required. This means:

* The output timeline will span from t=0 to t=`max(duration_bg, duration_fg)` seconds.
* FFmpeg’s default behavior for multiple inputs in a filtergraph like overlay is to run until the *end of the shortest input* unless configured. However, when we *do not* set the `shortest=1` flag on filters, the filter will run until the longest input ends. We must ensure we do this correctly:

  * If the BG is longer than FG, we want BG to continue playing alone after FG’s video ends. By default, the overlay filter will continue as long as the main (first) video has frames. We should specify `eof_action=pass` in the overlay filter, which tells FFmpeg that when the secondary (FG) stream ends, it should stop overlaying (i.e., just pass through the main video frames for the rest of the duration). This prevents output from cutting off when FG ends. For example: `overlay=x=X:y=Y:eof_action=pass` ensures the background keeps showing once FG is done.
  * If the FG is longer than BG, the situation is trickier because the “background” ends first. We still want to output the full FG duration. There are a couple of ways:

    * Treat FG as the main stream in filter (but then overlaying BG on FG might not make sense spatially if FG is smaller).
    * Or extend the BG stream artificially. We can append black frames (or repeat the last BG frame) for the remaining FG duration. FFmpeg has a filter `tpad` or we can use `concat` with a generated blank video. The simplest: after BG ends, we have nothing to overlay FG onto – one solution is to create a blank background of the same resolution for the rest of FG’s length. This could be done by splitting the process: output part1 = BG+FG over BG’s duration, part2 = FG alone over blank, then concatenate. However, to keep it simpler in one command, we could generate a `nullsrc` (solid color source) of the same resolution and duration = FG\_end - BG\_end, and overlay FG’s remaining part on that. This complexity might be beyond a minimal implementation, so we can opt to require BG >= FG duration in initial version, or simply allow the output to end when BG ends (not strictly meeting “use longer duration” if FG > BG). **However**, since the specification explicitly says use longer duration, we will implement the extension:

      * We’ll detect if FG\_duration > BG\_duration. If so, we pad the BG video with e.g. black frames. For instance, use FFmpeg filter: `color=c=black:size=<BG_res>:d=<pad_time>` to create a silent black video of the needed length, and then concatenate that with BG before overlay. Or use `tpad=stop_mode=clone:stop_duration=X` on BG to freeze its last frame for X more seconds.
      * Then apply overlay normally. This ensures the background “exists” for the full FG length (albeit as a still image or black screen after original BG ends). Since BG’s audio likely ended, the audio for that segment will either be silence or FG’s audio if FG’s audio is being used. We will choose based on the audio selection rules (discussed next).
    * This is an edge case; we expect typically the background (primary) video might be the longer one. But we handle it for completeness.
* **Audio Duration:** Using the longer duration means one audio may run out before the other. If we are using BG’s audio and BG is shorter than FG, then after BG audio ends, the output would go silent (since FG audio was dropped). This might be acceptable (the last part has video only). If that’s undesirable, one might consider cross-fading FG’s audio in after BG’s audio ends in that scenario – but the specification doesn’t mention mixing, so we won’t introduce audio from FG unless FG is the only audio source. We will document this behavior. Conversely, if BG is longer and FG audio was dropped, no issue (BG audio continues to end; FG had no audio or it’s irrelevant after FG video ends).

To summarize, by default we let FFmpeg output the longest stream. We use `eof_action=pass` to let the main video continue when the overlay ends (for BG > FG). For FG > BG, we extend BG artificially so that the overlay filter can continue to the end of FG. The output’s frame rate is set to the maximum of input FPS to maintain visual smoothness.

## Audio Track Selection for Output

Choosing the output audio depends on which videos have sound and the scenario:

* **Both Videos Have Audio:** We will **use the background video’s audio track** as the output audio. The background audio is presumably the primary audio we want (for example, in multi-camera filming, one camera might have the high-quality audio or the mix we prefer). By using only one audio source, we avoid echo or phasing issues. However, we *do* use the foreground’s audio during processing for alignment purposes. After syncing FG to BG, the FG’s audio will essentially duplicate the BG’s audio content (if they recorded the same event). Thus, we don’t include FG audio in the final mix to prevent doubling. The FG audio is effectively muted/dropped in the output.

  * **Aligning by Audio Peaks:** We ensure that when we overlay FG video, it’s aligned such that if FG audio were played, it would line up with BG audio. This way, even though we drop FG audio, the FG video motions (e.g., speaking or events) sync with BG’s sound. The user can see FG’s content in sync with BG’s sound.
  * If for some reason FG’s audio had additional information not in BG’s audio (uncommon if they record same event), mixing might be desirable. But since the task specifically says to use background’s audio, we stick to that rule.

* **Only One Video Has Audio:**

  * If only **background** has audio (FG is silent), we simply carry over BG’s audio in the output. FG is purely visual overlay.
  * If only **foreground** has audio (BG is silent), then we will use FG’s audio for output. In this case, aligning FG to BG using audio is impossible (BG has none), so likely we either place FG at t=0 or rely on some other cue. But once decided, we take FG’s audio as the single audio track in output. We need to ensure that if FG is not starting at t=0 on the timeline, the audio is delayed accordingly (using the same offset). For example, if we decide FG should start at 2s on BG, and BG is silent, we must pad 2s of silence at the start of FG’s audio in output so that FG’s audio plays exactly when FG’s video starts. Using `-itsoffset` on FG input will handle this automatically by introducing silence before FG’s audio starts.
  * In either case, if only one audio exists, there’s no conflict – we just pass that through to output.

* **Neither Video Has Audio:** The output will have no audio track (or we could optionally add silence). Typically, we’d just produce a video with no audio stream. We’ll log that “No audio present in either input; output will be silent.”

* **Mixing Audio (Not primary plan):** The user instructions seem to avoid mixing (they explicitly say use background’s audio if both have sound). We will abide by that. For completeness, though, if one wanted to mix (e.g., background audio is background noise and FG audio has commentary), FFmpeg’s `amerge` or `amix` filters could be used. This is outside our current requirements, so we won’t implement it, but our design (using FFmpeg filter\_complex) is flexible enough that it could be extended to merge audio if needed in the future.

**Implementation details in FFmpeg:** We will carefully map the audio stream:

* In the filter\_complex, we’ll primarily manipulate video streams (for overlay). Audio we might handle outside the filter, mapping directly. For example:

  ```
  ffmpeg -i bg.mp4 -itsoffset X -i fg.mp4 -filter_complex "[0:v][1:v] overlay=x=...:y=...:eof_action=pass [v]" -map "[v]" -map 0:a -c:v libx264 -c:a aac output.mp4
  ```

  Here we delay FG by X, overlay onto BG (BG is `[0:v]`, FG is `[1:v]`), map the resulting video, and map stream 0’s audio (background audio) as the output audio. FG’s audio is not mapped, effectively dropping it. We transcode video to H.264 and audio to AAC to ensure broad compatibility (unless we choose stream copy for audio if codecs allow).
* If FG’s audio is to be used (BG silent case), we’d do `-map 1:a` instead.
* We also handle the case of no audio appropriately (`-map 0:a` only if stream exists, etc., or use `-an` to explicitly produce no audio if needed).

We will use the above logic in code by building the ffmpeg command string dynamically based on the scenario, or use `ffmpeg-python` to programmatically build the filter graph.

## Robustness and Fallback Considerations

Despite automatic strategies, we must account for various edge cases to make the tool robust:

* **No Alignment Found:** If audio alignment finds no clear peak (e.g., correlation is very flat or multiple similar peaks), the tool may not be confident. Similarly for spatial alignment (feature matching might fail if scenes differ completely). In these cases, we have sensible defaults:

  * Temporal: If cross-correlation fails (low max correlation or ambiguous), log a warning and default to starting FG at t=0 (or possibly allow the user to specify an offset via an optional argument if they know it).
  * Spatial: If no match, default to center (or top-left). We could even allow a CLI flag like `--position center/top-left/x,y` as a manual override in future.
* **Performance Considerations:** Cross-correlation on long audio sequences can be heavy (O(n^2) in time domain, though using FFT reduces it). To keep things efficient:

  * We might limit the analysis to a window of audio. For instance, analyze the first N seconds of FG against a sliding window on BG rather than the entire tracks. If FG is significantly shorter than BG, it’s likely contained somewhere in BG of similar length, so full correlation is fine. If both are long (hours), we could downsample audio further or use fingerprinting. In MVP, assume video lengths are manageable (e.g., minutes, not hours).
  * Template matching every frame is expensive. We will do it for one or a few key frames (e.g., first, middle, last frame of FG) against a portion of BG. Possibly use downscaled frames (reduce resolution) for matching to reduce computation, then scale coordinates up – since we just need a rough alignment.
  * Feature matching is also done on single frames, and modern CPUs can handle ORB matching on typical video resolutions quickly. We’ll also restrict feature detection to perhaps a resized version of frames if needed to speed up.
* **Memory Usage:** Be mindful when loading audio – librosa or even SciPy will load the whole audio into memory as an array of floats. This can be large for long videos. If memory is a concern, we could stream audio or chunk it, but given typical usage (couple of minutes of audio), it should be fine. We can also down-sample to 8 kHz for alignment to cut data size further (with slight loss of precision).
* **File I/O:** Using FFmpeg means reading/writing potentially large files. We should ensure to handle path edge cases (spaces in filenames, etc.) by properly quoting or using `subprocess.list2cmdline` or passing arguments as list. Also ensure to clean up any intermediate files (like the extracted WAVs) after use. If performance allows, we can use `subprocess.PIPE` to feed audio data to Python without writing to disk (ffmpeg can output raw PCM to stdout which we read into numpy). That avoids temporary files – a nice optimization for later, but initially using temp files is simpler to implement and debug.
* **Error Handling:** The tool should validate inputs:

  * Check that input files exist and are readable.
  * If ffprobe fails to get info or ffmpeg fails to open a file, catch that and produce a user-friendly error.
  * Any exceptions in Python (e.g., in analysis) should be caught; we can use `logger.exception` in except blocks to log stack traces for debugging.
* **Logging and Verbosity:** Use logging levels to our advantage. Normal run can be at INFO level (brief messages about alignment chosen). A `--debug` flag could set DEBUG level, causing more verbose output (like correlation peak values, intermediate matching scores, etc.). This helps in diagnosing why a certain offset was picked.
* **Modularity and Testing:** By structuring the code into functions (`compute_audio_offset`, `compute_spatial_offset`, `compose_video` etc.), we can unit test those functions in isolation. For example, feed two known audio arrays to `compute_audio_offset` and verify it finds the correct offset. Similarly, test `compute_spatial_offset` with known images (we could craft a BG image containing a smaller FG image at a known position to see if it finds it).
* **Extensibility:** The design should allow future extension like handling multiple overlays (though currently one FG), or adding an option to output a side-by-side comparison instead of overlay (just as an example of repurposing alignment logic). By clearly separating alignment calculation from the ffmpeg invocation, we make the core logic reusable.
* **Clarity:** We’ll maintain clear variable names and document assumptions. For instance, if we assume the audio offset computed is where FG should *start* on BG timeline, we’ll clarify that in code comments. This avoids confusion between positive/negative lags.
* **Platform considerations:** Ensure the ffmpeg command built works on different OS (Windows might need slight tweaking in quoting). We may rely on the user having ffmpeg available in PATH. If not, we’d document that ffmpeg is a prerequisite. Alternatively, use a library like `ffmpeg-python` which uses the ffmpeg binaries under the hood, but we still need ffmpeg installed.

Overall, the tool will favor correct alignment. If something is uncertain, we lean towards notifying the user and using defaults rather than guessing and potentially creating a jarring output. Logging every significant decision (with reasons) will make the tool’s process transparent when needed.

## Minimal Viable Implementation Outline

Below is a high-level outline of how we will implement `vidoverlay.py`, adhering to best practices (Python 3.12):

1. **Argument Parsing (CLI Interface):** Use `argparse.ArgumentParser` to define `--bg`, `--fg`, `--output` (all required). Possibly add optional flags: `--no-audio-align` or `--no-video-align` to disable either alignment if the user wants raw overlay at t=0, or `--force-center` etc., for debugging. Also a `--verbose/--debug` flag to control log level.

   * Validate that the same path isn’t given for bg and fg, output path directory exists or is writable, etc.

2. **Setup Logging:** Import `logger` from loguru. Before heavy processing, configure loguru (e.g., `logger.remove()` default and `logger.add(sys.stderr, level="INFO")` or `"DEBUG"` if flag is set). Ensure log messages include context like function name or a prefix for each stage. Log start of the program with input file names.

3. **Probe Video Metadata:** Create a helper (e.g., `get_video_info(path)`) that uses `ffprobe` (via subprocess) to gather:

   * Duration (seconds or in time format).
   * Resolution (width x height).
   * Frame rate.
   * Audio presence (number of audio streams, channels, sample rate).
   * Alternatively, OpenCV can get width/height/fps quickly, and `ffmpeg` can give duration. We might use `ffmpeg` anyway for audio extraction, so using `ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=width,height,r_frame_rate,duration -of json` can give needed info in JSON. We’ll parse that (json module) for robust results.
   * Log the obtained metadata for both BG and FG (for debugging and confirmation to user). For example: “Background: 1920x1080, 24.0 fps, 120s, audio: yes; Foreground: 1280x720, 30.0 fps, 60s, audio: yes.”

4. **Spatial Offset Calculation:**

   * If BG\_size != FG\_size (especially BG larger):

     * Read one frame from each video for analysis. We might pick the first frame of FG and roughly the corresponding frame of BG (if we assume they start roughly together; if not, perhaps use BG frame at FG’s intended start time if we already have temporal offset by then – note: we can do spatial and temporal independently, but if content depends on time, we might first find time offset then spatial. We could iterate: find audio offset, seek BG to that time, grab BG frame, and FG frame at its start, then do spatial matching).
     * For simplicity, we can start with spatial alignment at time 0 (or mid). If audio offset is large, spatial content at t=0 might not match. **Better approach:** Perform audio alignment first (if applicable), get rough temporal alignment, then pick a frame from FG (say 5 seconds in) and from BG at (5+offset) seconds to do spatial alignment. This way, we’re comparing frames that should coincide in the event timeline. We will thus do **temporal alignment first**, then spatial.
     * Use OpenCV to load the chosen frames as grayscale (to avoid color differences issues). Apply `cv2.matchTemplate(bg_frame, fg_frame, cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED)` (if FG is smaller than BG). Retrieve the best match location and its score. Log the score. If score > threshold (e.g., >0.8), accept that location.
     * If FG is not necessarily fully within BG frame or angle differs, attempt ORB features:

       * `cv2.ORB.create()` -> detectAndCompute on both frames -> match descriptors using BFMatcher. Find clusters of matches that suggest a consistent displacement. If enough matches (say >10) are found, use them to compute an average offset (FG\_keypoint.pt – BG\_keypoint.pt). If the variance of these offsets is low, we consider it reliable.
       * (If perspective differences exist, we could find homography with `cv2.findHomography`, but since we only need a placement, we might ignore small rotations).
     * If no reliable result, set offset\_x = 0 and offset\_y = 0 (which means top-left) or perhaps center = ((BG\_w - FG\_w)/2, (BG\_h - FG\_h)/2). We lean toward center if unspecific.
   * If BG and FG are same resolution and content (which might mean two different takes of same scene), spatial alignment could mean they need to be exactly overlapping (maybe the user could crossfade between them?). But overlaying two full-frame videos typically doesn’t make sense visually (you’d just see FG entirely). Possibly not a use-case, but we’ll note that if dimensions match and user still wants overlay, we’ll just overlay directly (no offset, or offset 0,0). If they were slightly misaligned camera angles of the same scene, feature matching could theoretically find a small shift – but any shift means parts of FG won’t fit on BG frame, etc. We assume overlay in such a case might not be meaningful, so we won’t pursue that scenario deeply.

5. **Temporal Offset Calculation:**

   * If both have audio: call our `compute_audio_offset(bg_audio_path, fg_audio_path)` function which:

     * loads the WAVs (using SciPy or soundfile),
     * does cross-correlation (possibly using FFT for speed) as described earlier,
     * finds the max correlation index -> offset seconds.
     * We’ll also possibly trim correlation edges if one signal is much longer to avoid spurious matches (or explicitly correlate only a window of BG around the expected event length).
     * Return the offset (if offset is negative, clamp to 0 for now or handle by adjusting logic as discussed).
     * Log the raw lag (samples) and offset time.
   * If one or none have audio: default offset = 0. (In future, we could attempt video-based sync by analyzing image content changes over time – e.g., find when a muzzle flash or a certain motion happens in both – but that’s complex. We stick to 0 here and rely on user to provide manual offset if needed.)
   * The order of operations: It makes sense to do temporal alignment *before* spatial, because knowing when FG will appear on BG can help pick the right frames to match visually (as noted). So we will:

     * Extract audio, compute offset.
     * Seek BG video to that offset (if within BG duration) and read a frame; read FG video at time 0 (its start). These two frames should correspond to the same moment. If offset is larger than BG duration (meaning FG might actually start after BG ends, which could happen if FG started much later – unlikely), then spatial alignment is moot or not possible from content; we’d just default position.
     * Then do spatial matching on those frames.
   * One more consideration: If the audio alignment offset is huge (like FG starts far into BG), maybe we should verify if FG even overlaps in time with BG. If FG offset + FG\_duration > BG\_duration or similar, or if offset is basically BG\_duration (meaning FG starts when BG ends), that’s an edge scenario. We will allow output to have them back-to-back if that’s what audio says (though overlay at end is trivial).

6. **Video Composition (FFmpeg Processing):**

   * Construct the FFmpeg filter graph and command as determined:

     * Start with base command: `ffmpeg -y -i bg -i fg ...`
     * If we have a non-zero FG offset, include `-itsoffset <offset>` **before** the `-i fg` input (this ties to FG streams).
     * Build the filter\_complex:

       * If scaling needed (FG larger than BG or user explicitly wants scale): include `[1:v]scale=w=BG_width:h=BG_height[fgscaled]` if downscaling FG to fit (or a specific smaller size if needed).
       * Then overlay: e.g. `[0:v][fgscaled]overlay=x=offset_x:y=offset_y:eof_action=pass[outv]`. If we didn’t need scaling, we use `[1:v]` directly.
       * We might explicitly add `format=yuv420p` to ensure compatibility for mp4 output (since some overlays with alpha might produce yuv444 or such by default).
     * Map outputs: `-map "[outv]"`. For audio, as discussed:

       * If using BG audio: `-map 0:a -c:a copy` (if codecs compatible with mp4, e.g. AAC or MP3) or `-c:a aac` to re-encode if needed.
       * If using FG audio: `-map 1:a ...`.
       * If neither: `-an` for no audio.
     * Video codec: To ensure widely playable output, encode to H.264. Use `-c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 18` (for quality) or similar. Since speed isn’t top priority, we can afford a slower preset for better compression if needed. Alternatively, use `-c:v libx264 -crf 0` (lossless) if we want max quality, but that might be overkill. We can expose an argument for quality if desired; by default, a reasonable quality like CRF 18-20 is fine.
     * If output container is determined by `--output` extension (say .mov or .mp4), ensure chosen codecs are compatible (H.264/AAC works for both MP4 and MOV generally).
   * Run the ffmpeg subprocess. We will capture its stderr (progress logs) and possibly show a progress bar or at least not let it hang silently. FFmpeg can output progress if we add `-progress pipe:1` but parsing that might be extra – a simple approach is to let ffmpeg print to console or to our logger. Since this is a CLI tool, we can allow ffmpeg to print its standard output (or we add `-hide_banner -loglevel info` to reduce noise but still show encoding progress). Or use `logger.info` to echo important ffmpeg messages. In any case, the combination step might take time depending on video length, so feedback is good.

7. **Logging & Debug Info:** Throughout the above:

   * Log initial conditions and each decision (e.g., “Computed FG offset = 3.5s via audio cross-correlation, aligning accordingly”).
   * Log spatial placement (“Placing FG at (x=100, y=50) on BG (top-left corner of FG will be at BG pixel (100,50))”).
   * If any fallback was used, log it with reason (“Feature matching failed, defaulting FG position to center” or “FG has no audio, skipping audio alignment.”).
   * Use appropriate levels (INFO for high-level steps, DEBUG for detailed numbers or intermediate values).
   * If the user set debug, maybe dump correlation array to a file or mention peak correlation value.
   * At end, log success (“Output video saved to ...”). If ffmpeg returns non-zero, log an error.

8. **Cleanup:** Remove temp audio files if we wrote any. We’ll use Python’s `tempfile` module to safely create them (and perhaps set `delete=False` to inspect if debug, otherwise delete after use). If we piped data, no files to remove.

9. **Exit Codes:** Return a 0 exit code on success. On failure (exception or ffmpeg error), return a non-zero code. We might propagate ffmpeg’s error code or just use 1 for any failure. This way, it can be used in scripts reliably.

Pseudo-code example integrating some of these steps:

```python
def main():
    args = parse_args()
    logger.info(f"Overlaying FG='{args.fg}' onto BG='{args.bg}' ...")
    bg_info = get_video_info(args.bg)
    fg_info = get_video_info(args.fg)
    logger.info(f"BG: {bg_info.width}x{bg_info.height}, {bg_info.fps}fps, {bg_info.duration}s, audio={'yes' if bg_info.has_audio else 'no'}")
    logger.info(f"FG: {fg_info.width}x{fg_info.height}, {fg_info.fps}fps, {fg_info.duration}s, audio={'yes' if fg_info.has_audio else 'no'}")

    offset_sec = 0.0
    if bg_info.has_audio and fg_info.has_audio:
        offset_sec = compute_audio_offset(args.bg, args.fg)
        logger.info(f"Computed temporal offset = {offset_sec:.2f} seconds")
    else:
        logger.info("Skipping audio alignment (audio track missing in one or both videos)")

    x_off, y_off = 0, 0
    if bg_info.width > fg_info.width or bg_info.height > fg_info.height:
        x_off, y_off = compute_spatial_offset(args.bg, args.fg, offset_sec)
        logger.info(f"Computed spatial offset = ({x_off}, {y_off})")
    else:
        # FG not smaller than BG, just overlay at 0,0 or scale FG
        if fg_info.width > bg_info.width or fg_info.height > bg_info.height:
            logger.info("Foreground larger than background; will scale FG to fit BG.")
        else:
            logger.info("Foreground covers background; overlay with no offset.")
        # x_off,y_off remain 0 (or could set to center if sizes equal and we want to offset center)

    # Build ffmpeg command...
    ffmpeg_cmd = ["ffmpeg", "-y"]
    ffmpeg_cmd += ["-i", args.bg]
    if offset_sec > 0:
        ffmpeg_cmd += ["-itsoffset", str(offset_sec)]
    ffmpeg_cmd += ["-i", args.fg]
    filter_components = []
    if fg_info.width > bg_info.width or fg_info.height > bg_info.height:
        # scale fg to bg size
        filter_components.append(f"[1:v] scale={bg_info.width}:{bg_info.height} [fg]")
    else:
        filter_components.append(f"[1:v] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [fg]")  # also resets FG pts
    # overlay part
    filter_components.append(f"[0:v][fg] overlay=x={x_off}:y={y_off}:eof_action=pass [outv]")
    filter_complex = ",".join(filter_components)
    ffmpeg_cmd += ["-filter_complex", filter_complex, "-map", "[outv]"]
    # audio mapping
    if bg_info.has_audio and (not fg_info.has_audio or use_bg_audio):  # use_bg_audio is True by our rules when both have audio
        ffmpeg_cmd += ["-map", "0:a"]
    elif fg_info.has_audio:
        ffmpeg_cmd += ["-map", "1:a"]
    else:
        ffmpeg_cmd += ["-an"]
    # codec settings
    ffmpeg_cmd += ["-c:v", "libx264", "-crf", "18", "-preset", "slow", "-c:a", "aac", "-movflags", "+faststart", args.output]

    logger.debug(f"Running ffmpeg: {' '.join(ffmpeg_cmd)}")
    proc = subprocess.run(ffmpeg_cmd, capture_output=True)
    if proc.returncode != 0:
        logger.error(f"FFmpeg failed: {proc.stderr.decode()}")
        sys.exit(proc.returncode)
    logger.info(f"Overlay video created successfully: {args.output}")
```

(The above is illustrative; actual implementation may differ, but it shows the structure and use of logging.)

10. **Testing the Implementation:** We will test with simple scenarios:

    * Two identical videos (should overlay perfectly at 0 offset).
    * FG is a cropped region of BG (should find correct spatial placement via template matching).
    * Two videos of the same event with a known time gap (verify the audio sync works).
    * Edge: FG without audio, BG with audio (should just overlay from t=0 with BG audio).
    * Edge: FG longer than BG (verify output length covers FG’s end, BG video perhaps frozen or black during FG’s tail, and BG audio stops with silence after).
    * Logging output should be checked to ensure it’s informative and not overly verbose at INFO level.

Throughout development, maintain clean code with functions and possibly a class to encapsulate state if needed. We’ll also use type hints for clarity (Python 3.12 supports typing enhancements) and docstrings for each function.

## Maintaining Clarity, Debuggability, and Logging

To conclude, clarity and maintainability are top priorities:

* The code will be organized into logical units (parsing, alignment calculations, ffmpeg composition).
* We will use descriptive names and comments to make the flow understandable.
* **Loguru** will be leveraged to capture the program flow and decisions in a human-readable way, without the fuss of configuring the standard logger. This means easier debugging if something goes wrong in the field – users can run with `--debug` to get detailed logs and even share those logs for support.
* We avoid overly clever one-liners or obscure FFmpeg incantations without explanation – each major step will be documented (either in code comments or logged) so that future developers (or the same developer in 6 months) can follow what’s happening.
* We plan for extensibility by not hardcoding values where not necessary (e.g., if we foresee adding more formats or more inputs, we don’t write code that only ever works with exactly 2 inputs beyond what’s needed).

By following this plan, `vidoverlay.py` will be a reliable, easy-to-use CLI tool that smartly overlays two videos with proper alignment of content and timing. The approach blends powerful libraries (FFmpeg’s encoding, OpenCV’s vision, SciPy’s signal processing) in a coordinated way, all while keeping the implementation clean and debuggable. Each design choice has been made to satisfy the requirements with accuracy and robustness in mind, even if it adds a bit more computation (aligning peaks, searching images) – which aligns with the goal of prioritizing alignment precision over raw speed.

**Sources:**

* OpenCV Template Matching documentation – explains using `cv.matchTemplate` to find a template image within a larger image.
* Reddit discussion on image alignment – confirms using template matching for straightforward cases and feature matching + homography for more complex alignment.
* Dev.to article on audio fragment search – demonstrates using cross-correlation via FFT to find where a short audio clip occurs within a longer clip.
* FFmpeg usage notes – by default, filters like hstack/overlay run to the longest input’s length unless overridden; using `eof_action=pass` ensures the primary video continues after overlay ends.
* Loguru documentation – highlights that Loguru simplifies logging setup by removing the need for explicit logger/handler/formatter management, aiding in keeping our logging clear and easy.

<task1>
[x] Analyze the problem and the plans. Choose the best plan and in `vidoverlay.py`, write a well-structured, clean, elegant, fast implementation. Then test: `vlveo-buenos-diego2.mp4` is a good fg video, and `vlveo-buenos-diego3_starlight-24.mp4` is a good bg video.  
</task1>

<task2>
[x] So, it generally works. However, I’d like some additional improvements. The task is to find a method in which the fg aligns with the bg as well as possible. Rather than just going by duration, we should also just consider the frames themselves. With a CLI switch I should be able to choose whether I prefer audio or duration or frames count to be the primary source of alignment. Temporally, we really really need to ensure that if we have, say, one video with the frames `ABCDEFHKOPQZ` and another video with the frames `adjlmyz`, at different FPSes and of slighly different durations, we still manage to find the best match possible so that we actually overlay a over A, z over Z, and then we overlay the closest frames. Basically we should match up "keyframes" and then we could duplicate intermediate frames especially in the video that has lower FPS to line them up. If we have a situation like one video has `BCDEFG` and the `abcdef` then the result should be `a+bB+cC+dD+eE+fF+G`, but there should be a `trim` CLI option that makes `bB+cC+dD+eE+fF` instead. Got it?

<task3>
[x] I ran

for spatial_method in template feature; do for temporal_align in audio duration frames; do ./vidoverlay.py --bg vlveo-buenos-diego3_cloud_apo8_prob4.mp4 --fg vlveo-buenos-diego2.mp4 --spatial_method $spatial_method --temporal_align $temporal_align -o test-${spatial_method}-${temporal_align}.mp4; done; done;

and I got six files. It’s hard to tell between `template` and `feature`, but temporally, `duration` works out best, so far. 

The other methods are not as good. I would expect the `frames` method to be better. The general problem is that there's a repeating "desync". There should be a way to better align the frames by similarity. 

See screenshot.
