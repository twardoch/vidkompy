# Tunnel-Based Temporal Alignment - Implementation Complete

## 1. Overview

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: This specification has been fully implemented and deployed. The tunnel-based temporal alignment engines have been integrated into vidkompy as the primary alignment methods.

The approach successfully replaced traditional perceptual hashing/fingerprinting with direct frame comparison using sliding windows. Two high-performance temporal alignment engines are now available:

1. **full** (formerly tunnel_full): Uses full frame comparison - now the default engine
2. **mask** (formerly tunnel_mask): Uses masked frame comparison focusing on content regions

## 2. Key Concept

Instead of pre-computing fingerprints for all frames, this approach:

- Iterates through each foreground (FG) frame sequentially
- Uses a sliding window in the background (BG) video to find the best match
- Performs matching from both ends (start and end) of the video
- Enforces monotonicity by constraining the search window to frames after the previous match

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1. Full Engine (`full`, formerly `tunnel_full`)

#### 3.1.1. Algorithm:

1. **Forward Pass (from start)**:

   - Start with FG frame 0
   - Search within a window of BG frames (e.g., frames 0-30) for the best match
   - Best match = minimum pixel difference between FG frame and BG frame (cropped to FG region)
   - Once found, move to FG frame 1
   - Constrain BG search window to start from the matched BG frame index + 1
   - Continue until all FG frames are matched

2. **Backward Pass (from end)**:

   - Start with last FG frame
   - Search within a window of BG frames near the end for the best match
   - Once found, move to previous FG frame
   - Constrain BG search window to end before the matched BG frame index - 1
   - Continue backward until all FG frames are matched

3. **Merge Strategy**:
   - Combine forward and backward mappings
   - Use confidence scores based on match quality
   - Apply smoothing to eliminate any remaining discontinuities

#### 3.1.2. Frame Comparison Method:

```python
def compute_frame_difference(fg_frame, bg_frame, x_offset, y_offset):
    # Crop BG frame to FG region
    bg_cropped = bg_frame[y_offset:y_offset+fg_height, x_offset:x_offset+fg_width]

    # Compute pixel-wise difference
    diff = np.abs(fg_frame.astype(float) - bg_cropped.astype(float))

    # Return mean absolute difference
    return np.mean(diff)
```

### 3.2. Mask Engine (`mask`, formerly `tunnel_mask`)

Similar to `full` but with an additional masking step:

#### 3.2.1. Masking Strategy:

1. Create a binary mask identifying the actual content region in FG frames (non-black areas)
2. Apply this mask during frame comparison to focus only on content regions
3. This helps when FG video has letterboxing or pillarboxing

#### 3.2.2. Modified Frame Comparison:

```python
def compute_masked_frame_difference(fg_frame, bg_frame, x_offset, y_offset, mask):
    # Crop BG frame to FG region
    bg_cropped = bg_frame[y_offset:y_offset+fg_height, x_offset:x_offset+fg_width]

    # Apply mask to both frames
    fg_masked = fg_frame * mask
    bg_masked = bg_cropped * mask

    # Compute pixel-wise difference only in masked region
    diff = np.abs(fg_masked.astype(float) - bg_masked.astype(float))

    # Return mean absolute difference normalized by mask area
    return np.sum(diff) / np.sum(mask)
```
