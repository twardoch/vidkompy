## Core Frame Composition Rules

### Foreground Priority
- All foreground frames must be preserved exactly without modification
- Background frames are adapted/retimed to match foreground
- Foreground determines final frame rate and timing
- Quality thresholds enforce foreground integrity

### Frame Alignment Pipeline
1. Spatial Positioning
- Template matching determines optimal x/y offset
- Border region analysis for letterboxed content
- Quality-driven fallback to center positioning

2. Temporal Synchronization
- Frame fingerprinting using perceptual hash ensemble
- Sliding window DTW with monotonicity constraints
- Bidirectional refinement prevents temporal drift

### Quality Control Rules
- Frame confidence scoring with minimum thresholds
- Automatic rejection of poor quality matches
- Fallback strategies for failed alignments
- Strict validation of temporal sequence integrity

### Audio Composition 
- Foreground audio takes precedence when available
- Background audio used as fallback
- Synchronization locked to foreground timing
- No audio stretching/retiming allowed

## Engine-Specific Rules

### Full Engine
- Direct pixel comparison
- Strict monotonic frame progression
- Zero temporal drift by design
- No frame interpolation allowed

### Mask Engine  
- Content-aware region masking
- Black border detection and filtering
- Maintained temporal monotonicity
- Enhanced letterboxed content handling
