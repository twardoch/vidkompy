# Progress: vidkompy Refactoring

## Round 1: Analysis and Architecture Design

### Phase 1: Understanding Current Implementation

- [x] Analyze vidkompy_old.py structure and functionality
- [x] Document key functions and their purposes
- [x] Identify pain points and areas for improvement
- [x] Map out dependencies and data flow

### Phase 2: Modular Architecture Design

- [x] Design module structure (core, alignment, temporal, spatial, cli)
- [x] Define interfaces between modules
- [x] Plan data structures for video metadata and alignment results
- [x] Create module dependency diagram

### Phase 3: Core Module Implementation

- [x] Create vidkompy.py as main entry point
- [x] Implement video_processor.py for core video operations
- [x] Create alignment_engine.py for coordination
- [x] Implement metadata extraction and validation

## Round 2: Alignment Module Implementation

### Phase 4: Spatial Alignment

- [x] Extract spatial alignment logic from old code
- [x] Create spatial_alignment.py module
- [x] Implement template matching method
- [x] Implement feature matching method
- [x] Add center alignment fallback

### Phase 5: Temporal Alignment - Audio

- [x] Create temporal_alignment.py module
- [x] Implement audio extraction and analysis
- [x] Implement cross-correlation for audio sync
- [x] Add fallback mechanisms

### Phase 6: Temporal Alignment - Frames (Complete Rewrite)

- [x] Analyze current frames method issues
- [x] Design new algorithm preserving all fg frames
- [x] Implement frame similarity metrics
- [x] Create optimal bg-to-fg frame mapping
- [x] Ensure no fg frame retiming occurs
- [x] Test with various frame rate combinations

## Round 3: CLI and Integration

### Phase 7: CLI Improvements

- [ ] Update CLI arguments (--match_time fast/precise)
- [ ] Implement argument validation
- [ ] Add better progress reporting with rich
- [ ] Enhance verbose logging with loguru

### Phase 8: Testing and Validation

- [ ] Test with provided bg.mp4 and fg.mp4
- [ ] Verify spatial alignment accuracy
- [ ] Validate temporal alignment (all methods)
- [ ] Check output quality and frame preservation
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

### Phase 9: Documentation and Cleanup

- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with all changes
- [ ] Update README.md with new usage
- [ ] Add inline documentation
- [ ] Clean up old code references
- [ ] Final code formatting and linting

## Key Principles for Implementation

1. Foreground video is never retimed - all frames preserved
2. Background frames are mapped to foreground frames optimally
3. Modular design with clear separation of concerns
4. Robust error handling and fallbacks
5. Comprehensive logging for debugging
