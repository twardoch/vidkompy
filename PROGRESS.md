# Progress: vidkompy Performance Improvements

## Completed Tasks

### Temporal Alignment Research & Design
- [x] Analyzed current temporal alignment implementation and identified drift issues
- [x] Researched best practices for precise video synchronization
- [x] Created SPEC.md with detailed design for 'precise' engine
- [x] Added --engine CLI parameter to support multiple alignment engines
- [x] Implemented precise temporal alignment engine with multi-resolution approach
- [x] Tested both engines and confirmed performance characteristics
- [x] Updated README.md with comprehensive documentation of both engines
- [x] Added detailed performance benchmarks and usage examples

### Drift Issue Resolution
- [x] Identified root cause of 5-second drift issue in precise engine
- [x] Implemented spatial cropping for temporal alignment (crop background to foreground region)
- [x] Added crop parameter support to VideoProcessor.extract_all_frames()
- [x] Integrated spatial alignment step before temporal alignment in precise engine
- [x] Tuned drift correction parameters (interval: 32→100, blend factor: 0.7→0.85)
- [x] Added drift tracking and logging for debugging
- [x] Verified fix resolves hand movement synchronization issue
