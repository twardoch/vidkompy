- [x] Created SPEC.md with detailed design for 'precise' engine
- [x] Added --engine CLI parameter to support multiple alignment engines
- [x] Implemented precise temporal alignment engine with multi-resolution approach
- [x] Tested both engines and confirmed performance characteristics
- [x] Updated README.md with comprehensive documentation of both engines
- [x] Added detailed performance benchmarks and usage examples

## Future Optimizations (Not Yet Implemented)

### Performance Enhancements
- [ ] GPU acceleration with CuPy for phase correlation
