## Future Optimizations (Not Yet Implemented)

### Performance Enhancements
- [ ] GPU acceleration with CuPy for phase correlation
- [ ] FAISS integration for fast similarity search
- [ ] Replace OpenCV with PyAV for faster video I/O
- [ ] Implement sliding window refinement for drift correction (This was part of the precise engine, but could be reviewed/enhanced based on Idea 1's impact)
- [ ] Hierarchical multi-resolution matching (This is part of the precise engine, could be tuned)

### Architecture Improvements
- [ ] Replace template matching with phase correlation for spatial alignment
- [ ] Use neural embeddings (MobileNet) instead of perceptual hashes
- [ ] Implement proper fallback strategies for edge cases
- [ ] Add caching for repeated video pairs
- [ ] Implement Improvement Idea 2 (Optical Flow-Assisted Consistency) from SPEC.md
- [ ] Implement Improvement Idea 3 (Dominant Path DTW) from SPEC.md
- [ ] Fix CLI `-w` (window) parameter bug for `precise` engine (not used effectively).

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for new drift correction and smoothing.
- [ ] Create performance benchmark suite (or adapt existing `benchmark.sh` to test new config parameters).
- [ ] Add type hints throughout (ongoing).
- [ ] Improve error handling and recovery.
- [ ] Resolve remaining linter errors for line length in `multi_resolution_aligner.py`.
